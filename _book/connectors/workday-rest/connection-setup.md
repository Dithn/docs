# Workday REST Connection

## How to connect to Workday on Workato

The Workday REST connector uses the [Workday REST API](https://doc.workday.com/reader/wsiU0cnNjCc_k7shLNxLEA/HvgwLwxCHVdBlZUTNd9s7A). Workday recommends using an Integration System User (ISU) for integration using third party services like Workato.

## API Client
You will need to create an API client to connect to Workday REST API. There are 2 ways to connect using API clients:
1. Authorize using a user account
2. Use an API Client for Integration

### API Client for user account
Use a regular **API Client** to authorize a connection to the REST API using a user account.

First, navigate to the **View API Clients** page by typing it into the search bar. You should see this screen. Here, you will see the endpoints required for the connection. Take note of **REST API endpoint**, **Token endpoint** and **Authorization endpoint**.

Click on an existing API Clients that is available to integration if there are any. Otherwise, you need to create a new one. Navigate to **Register API Client** in your Workday instance.

![Register API Client](/assets/images/workday-rest/register-api-client.png)
*Registering a new client*

- Enter a meaningful name to indicate that this API client is used for Workato recipes
- Select **Authorization Code Grant** for **Client Grant Type**
- Select **Bearer** for **Access Token Type**
- Use `https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback` as the Redirection URL
- Select all the **OAuth2 scopes** and **Functional Area scope** that you need for the recipes you intend to create

Remember to save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** before clicking **Done**. This will be required to create a Workday REST connection.

### API Client for Integrations
If you wish to use a manually generated token to connect to Workday, you will need to register an **API client for integration**. This is required when using an ISU that does not have login access and is used only for API access.

Navigate to **Register API Client for integration** in your Workday instance.

- Enter a meaning name to indicate that this API client is used for Workato recipes
- Select **Non-Expiring Refresh Tokens** to avoid regenerating and reconnecting
- Select all the **OAuth2 scopes** and **Functional Area scope** that you need for the recipes you intend to create
