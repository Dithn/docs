# Building a HTTP trigger
After you have setup your [HTTP connection](/developing-connectors/http/connection-setup.md), you can now configure HTTP triggers.

The HTTP connector supports **New Event via Polling**. Each new/updated record will be processed as a trigger event. If there are more than 100 events within the poll interval, those above 100 may be dropped.

If your use-case requires you to respond immediately to trigger events and your app allows you to create webhooks, you can use a webhooks trigger from the [Webhooks connector](/connectors/workato-webhooks.md).

## New Event via polling
This trigger fetches events at each polling interval. Workato will make a `GET` request to the URL that you provided. The corresponding data returned will be converted into useable datapills in subsequent actions.

<!--- The poll interval can be 10 mins or 5 mins, depending on your plan. Check the [Pricing and Plans page](https://workato.com/princing?audience-general) to find out more. --->
