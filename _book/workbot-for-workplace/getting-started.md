# Getting started with Workbot for Workplace by Workato
## What is Workato?
> **If you're familiar with Workato, or want to quickly get started with Workbot, skip to [Setup Workbot](#setup-workbot).**

Workato helps you automate business workflows across cloud apps, on-premise apps and employees, e.g. New case in Salesforce will create issue in Jira & incident in ServiceNow, and more.

Workato combines enterprise-grade workflow automation with the ease-of-use expected from consumer apps, allowing business users and IT to quickly build workflow automations.

## Workbot for Workplace, powered by Workato
> **If you're familiar with Workbot, skip to [Setup Workbot](#setup-workbot).**

Workbot is a bot platform built on top of Workato. It helps you run these business workflows directly from Workplace.

These business workflows can be initiated from Workplace by using [Workbot commands](/workbot-for-workplace/workbot-triggers.md). When the command is sent to Workbot (via direct messages or group chats), it will look for the corresponding workflow in Workato and execute the workflow steps.

*Sending a 'salesforce' command. The retrieves open opportunities in Salesforce, then sends a reply*

These workflows — combined with Workbot — allow you to retrieve, create and update data across all your apps - directly within Workplace.

In Workato, these powerful workflows are known as **Recipes**.

## Recipes
Recipes are automated workflows built by users that can span multiple apps.

Each recipe comprises of a **Trigger** and one or more **Actions** that are carried out when a trigger event occurs.

## Workbot command trigger
Workbot commands allow you to trigger recipes from Workplace. These recipes can then perform actions in your apps (e.g. creating new ServiceNow tickets, listing Salesforce opportunities).
