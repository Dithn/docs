# Using Workbot for Workplace
## Workbot commands
You can perform actions in your apps (e.g. creating new Github issues, listing Salesforce opportunities) by sending Workbot commands from within Workplace.

*Sending a 'newissue' command with additional parameters in Workplace, then receiving a post reply*

A Workbot command is a trigger that allows you to run a Workbot command recipe.

### Workbot 'help'
If you get stuck, you can always send the **help** command to Workbot. Workbot will respond with the list of commands available to you.

### Invoking Workbot commands in Workplace
Workbot commands can be invoked in 2 distinct ways:
1. Sending the command in a direct message to Workbot or in a channel (in a channel, this requires tagging Workbot i.e. **@workbot your_command**)<br><br>

2. Sending the command when a button is clicked<br><br>

Commands can also prompt users for additional parameters. For example, to create a new Github ticket, the user should provide the title and description of the incident. In this case, you can add 2 parameters; `title` & `description`. When the command is invoked, Workbot will prompt the user for each parameter.

*Workbot can ask users for info if you specify additional parameters in your command*

## Event notifications using Post message action
Workbot can also be used to notify you when any events occur in your apps. This can be done via the **Post message** action.

*A Post reply action notifying user about a new incident in ServiceNow*

The **Post message** & **Post simple message** actions allow you to post a message to a user or in a channel.
