# Workbot command trigger
Workbot commands allow you to trigger recipes from Workplace. These recipes can then perform actions in your apps (e.g. creating new ServiceNow tickets, listing Salesforce opportunities).

This means you can from perform actions in your apps from within Workplace!

![Command example](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/workbot-command-example.png)
*Sending a 'new_issue' command with additional parameters in Workplace, then receiving a reply*

When a command is sent to Workbot in Workplace, it will trigger the Workbot recipe and execute its actions.

#### Command name
Workbot commands can invoke their recipes by:
1.  Sending the command name in a direct message to Workbot, e.g. **new_issue**
2. Sending the command name in a channel and tagging Workbot, e.g. **@workbot new_issue**
3. Submitting a command button with the command name configured:
![Command name in button](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/command-button.png)<br>*A button can be configured to invoke another Workbot recipe*<br>
4. Submitting a quick reply button with the command name configured:
![Command name in button](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/command-quick-reply-button.png)<br>*Quick reply button configured to invoke another Workbot recipe*<br>
![Command name in button example](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/button-click.png)
*The 'Next' button invokes the 'new_issue' command and executes the recipe when submitted*

#### Parameters
Commands can also prompt users for additional parameters. For example, to create a new Github ticket, the user should provide the `title` and `description` of the incident.

In this case, you can add 2 parameters; `title` & `description`. When the command is invoked, Workbot will prompt the user for each parameter.

![Collecting parameters](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/collecting-parameters.png)
*Workbot can ask users for info if you specify additional parameters in your command*

Users can also skip the prompts by supplying the parameters together with the command.

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

##### Advanced methods to pass parameter values
Parameter values can also be passed by buttons and quick reply buttons when they invoke a downstream Workbot command recipe. Typically, you use parameters to pass additional context for downstream Workbot recipe to use.

![Command name in button](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/command-button.png)
*A 'Duplicate incident' button which invokes the 'new_issue' recipe, passing it context about the incident to be duplicated.*

![Command name in quick reply button](/assets/images/workbot-for-workplace/command-quick-reply-button.png)
*A 'Duplicate incident' quick reply button which invokes the 'new_issue' recipe, passing it context about the incident to be duplicated.*
