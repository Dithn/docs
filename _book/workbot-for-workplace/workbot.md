Workbot for Workplace is a Workato chatbot that helps you monitor and interact with your business apps from within Workplace.

Your team can configure Workbot to post messages to Workplace users and channels when important events happen, e.g. when a key customer files a ticket, a lead from a Fortune 500 company fills in a form on your website, or when a DevOps alert is created.

You can also retrieve, create and update data from your apps from within Workplace, by sending commands to Workbot.
