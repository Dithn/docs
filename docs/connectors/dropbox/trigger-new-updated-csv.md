# Dropbox trigger - New/updated CSV file in directory
Triggers when a new CSV file is added or existing CSV file is updated in a specified folder. New and updated CSV files in subfolders will also be picked up.

## Input fields

| Field name | Description |
|---|---|
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | When you start recipe for the first time, it picks up CSV files modified from this specified date and time. Defaults to fetching CSV files created/updated an hour ago if left blank. Once recipe has been run or tested, value cannot be changed. [Learn more about this field here.](/recipes/triggers.md#since-from) |
| Folder / Folder path | The folder to monitor for new/updated CSV files. Sub-folders will also be monitored. |
| Column delimiter | The character used to separate column values in your CSV file. |
| Batch size | Number of CSV rows to process per batch. Instead of reading rows one by one, Workato reads a batch of CSV rows at a time to increase throughput. [Learn more about batch processing](/features/batch-processing.md). |
| Obtain a direct URL to file? | Generate a public URL that lives for 4 hours. This URL can be obtained from the `URL` data pill in the trigger output. |
| Add column names manually? | Set column names manually. Otherwise the first row of the latest CSV file in the selected folder will be taken to get column names. |
| Column names | Enter CSV column names, each on a new line. By default, the column names of the latest CSV file in your selected folder will be retrieved. |
