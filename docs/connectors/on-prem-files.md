# On-prem Files
This connector lets you integrate with files within a secure network. These files typically are behind a corporate firewall and cannot be accessed directly. To create a connection to on-prem files, you **must** use an [On-prem agent](/on-prem.md).

Workato's `On-prem files` connector allows you to securely connect to those on-premises files and build automation around them.

## How to connect to on-prem files on Workato
Before creating a connection for this connector, make sure you go through an [on-prem agent setup](/on-prem/agents/setup.md) and create a profile for [on-prem files](/on-prem/agents/profile.md#on-prem-files-profile).

## Working with the On-prem files connector

### Relative path
Relative path is a way to specify the location of a file or folder based on the location of another folder. This is different from absolute path where you specify the full location of a file.

File or folder path in the on-prem files connector are all relative paths. It is relative to the base path you define in the connection [profile](/on-prem/agents/profile.md#on-prem-files-profile) of your `config.yml` file. Let's take a look at an example.

Here, we have a profile with the base path defined as the `/Users/admin/projects` folder using the `base` property.
```yml
files:
  projects:
    base: /Users/admin/projects
```

Now, if you wish to point to a file in this sub-folder `/Users/admin/projects/engineering/2018_roadmap.csv`, you will have to use the relative path `/engineering/2018_roadmap.csv`. When used in a download file action, it will look like this.

Similarly, to point to a sub-folder `/Users/admin/projects/marketing/users`, use the relative path `/marketing/users`.

### Naming pattern
Frequently, you may have a log of multiple files with a naming convention. These names typically either includes an incremental count to represent the versions or timestamp to represent the effective date of the contents. Defining a naming pattern allows you to filter files based on these naming conventions. Workato uses the `?` and `*` symbols to represent any single character or multiple characters respectively.

#### Single character wildcard `?`
The `?` symbol is used to represent any character once. For example, `Report_draft_?.pdf` can be used to represent `Report_draft_1.pdf`, `Report_draft_2.pdf` and `Report_draft_3.pdf`.

#### Multiple character wildcard `*`
The `*` symbol is used to represent any zero or more characters. For example, `Report_draft*.pdf` can be used to represent `Report_draft.pdf`, `Report_draft_1.pdf`, `Report_draft_2.pdf` and `Report_draft_3.pdf`.

#### Using naming pattern in a recipe

Let's look at an example of a marketing manager who needs to work with a folder that contains a few type of information series of webinar.

:open_file_folder: Marketing
  - :open_file_folder:  ProductHour
      - :page_facing_up: Attendees_2018_11_29.csv
      - :page_facing_up: Attendees_2018_11_15.csv
      - :page_facing_up: Attendees_2018_11_01.csv
      - :clipboard: Poll_responses_2018_11_29.txt
      - :clipboard: Poll_responses_2018_11_15.txt
      - :clipboard: Poll_responses_2018_11_01.txt
      - :bar_chart: Slides_2018_11_29.pptx
      - :bar_chart: Slides_2018_11_15.pptx
      - :bar_chart: Slides_2018_11_01.pptx

Based on each use case, files from this folder can be filtered in a number of ways.
