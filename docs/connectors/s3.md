# Amazon S3
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services, that provides scalable and highly flexible cloud storage through web services interfaces.

## API version
The Amazon S3 connector uses [Amazon S3 REST API, version 2006-03-01](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).

## Working with Amazon S3 connector

### Terminology
The [terminology](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/AmazonS3Basics.html) for common Amazon S3 data can be found below.

- **Buckets**

Buckets are containers that hold objects. The geographical region where this bucket and its contents will be stored can be defined by the user.

- **Objects**

An object consists of a file, and optionally any metadata describing that file.

### Using the new file trigger
The new file trigger listens to new files uploaded into a specific Amazon S3 bucket. The trigger event contains only metadata about the file, however, such as file name and size. To retrieve content of the file, use the **Download file** action.

## Troubleshooting

### Exact, case sensitive names
When defining bucket and object by names in Amazon S3, take note that names should be exact and are case sensitive.
