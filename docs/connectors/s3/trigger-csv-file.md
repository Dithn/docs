# Amazon S3 trigger - New CSV file
Triggers when a CSV file is added in a selected bucket/folder in Amazon S3.

Checks selected folder for new or updated CSV file once every poll interval. The output includes the fileâ€™s metadata and file contents, which are CSV rows delivered in batches.

Note that in Amazon S3, when a file is renamed, it is considered a new file. When a file is uploaded and overwrites an existing file with the same name, it is considered an updated file but not a new file.

## Input fields
| Field name   | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| When first started, this recipe should pick up events from | When recipe starts for the first time, it will pick up CSV files created from this specified time. Once recipe has been run or tested, value cannot be changed. [Learn more about this field here](/recipes/triggers.md#since-from). |
| Region       | The region of the bucket to monitor for new/updated file, e.g. us-west-2. In Amazon S3, go to **Bucket > Properties > Static website hosting** to find your region in the Endpoint URL. |
| Bucket       | The bucket to monitor for new CSV file. Select a bucket from the picklist or enter the bucket name directly. |
| Column separator | Delimiter separating the columns in the CSV file. |
| Folder path  | The folder to monitor for new CSV files. Define full path _(e.g. folder 1/subfolder 1)_. Sub-folders will not be monitored. Root folder or restricted folder is used by default. |
| Include files not ending with .csv? | Handle the cases when your CSV files exported from other systems may not have `.csv` extension. Ensure that all files in this folder are CSV parsables. |
| Column names | The column names of the CSV file. You can manually define the column names with each column header per line. |
| Batch size   | Workato divides the CSV file into smaller batches to process more efficiently. This field defines the number of CSV rows to process in each batch (Maximum of 1000 rows/batch). Use a larger batch size to increase data throughput. In some cases, Workato will automatically reduce batch size to avoid exceeding API limit. [Learn more about Batch Processing](/features/batch-processing.md). |
| Skip header row? | Select **Yes** if CSV file contains header row. Workato will not process that row as data.  |


This trigger supports [Trigger Condition](/recipes/triggers.md#trigger-conditions), which allows you to filter trigger events.
