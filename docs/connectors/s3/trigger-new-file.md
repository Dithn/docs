# Amazon S3 trigger - New file
Triggers when a new file is added in a selected bucket/folder in Amazon S3.

Checks selected folder for new file once every poll interval. The output includes the fileâ€™s metadata and file contents. The file contents is returned as a [streaming object](/features/file-streaming.md) and can handle unlimited file size.

Note that in Amazon S3, when a file is renamed, it is considered a new file. When a file is uploaded and overwrites an existing file with the same name, it is considered an updated file but not a new file.

## Input fields
| Field name  | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Region      | The region of the bucket to monitor for new/updated file, e.g. us-west-2. In Amazon S3, go to **Bucket > Properties > Static website hosting** to find your region in the Endpoint URL. |
| Bucket      | The bucket to monitor for new CSV file. Select a bucket from the picklist or enter the bucket name directly. |
| Folder path | The folder to monitor for new CSV files. Define full path _(e.g. folder 1/subfolder 1)_. Sub-folders will not be monitored. Root folder or restricted folder is used by default. |
| Chunk size<br>(in kilobytes) | Default is 1024 KB, minimum is 32 KB. Workato manages the chunk size automatically by default. Configure this when you want to optimize the data throughput yourself. Larger chunk size will increase throughput, but may exceed API limit. |

This trigger supports [Trigger Condition](/recipes/triggers.md#trigger-conditions), which allows you to filter trigger events.
