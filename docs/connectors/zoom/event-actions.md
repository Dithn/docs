# Zoom - Webinar, meetings and cloud recordings
Webinars and meetings can be easily scheduled and updated using the Workato Zoom connector. Beyond that, the connector also supports a wide range of actions that can help you manage your webinars, meetings and cloud recordings which we collectively call **Events**. You'll be able to update events in Zoom as well as pull information from events.

The Zoom connector supports the following **event** actions:
* [Scheduling meetings or webinars](#schedule-meetings-or-webinars)
* [Update event details](#update-event-details)
* [Search event details](#search-event-details)
* [Get event details](#get-event-details)
* [Retrieve webinar results](#retrieve-webinar-results)
