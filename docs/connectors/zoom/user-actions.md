# Zoom - User actions
Manage users in your Zoom organisation easily with the Zoom connector's user actions. These actions help you to automate the process of onboarding or offboarding employees from your company if they require Zoom accounts for video conferencing.

The Zoom connector supports the following **user** actions:
* [Create user](#create-user)
* [Update user](#update-user)
* [Search users](#search-users)
* [Get user](#get-user)
* [Delete user](#delete-user)

## Create user
