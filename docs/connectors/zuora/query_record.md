# Zuora - Query record action

## Query record action
This action queries records in Zuora using [Zuora Object Query Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/BC_ZOQL). The Zuora Object Query Language (ZOQL) is a simple SQL-like query language used to construct query calls in the SOAP API.

Basic knowledge and experience with SQL is required to work with ZOQL
