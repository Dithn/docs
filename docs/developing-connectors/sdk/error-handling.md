# Error Handling
Exposing detailed and helpful error message can improve the recipe building experience for you and the end users of your custom connector. However, default custom connector actions and triggers do not expose response messages. Additionally, you may want to expose error messages in other instances (such as when action/trigger input data does not meet certain business requirements). This can be achieved using the following helper methods.

## Input validation
You can raise custom errors for inputs that violate business logic. Let's use an example of a search action that tries to search for a **Contact** using a search action. You want to make sure that the user is searching for records with at least one search criteria. In this case, you will want to raise an error if there are no input values, instead of sending a request with no query parameters.

### `error`
This is a Workato SDK specific method to raise a job error with a custom message. The error method accepts arguments which will then be surfaced to end users in the Workato platform when they trigger an error using your custom connector. This can be used in a number of ways to improve usability for your custom connector.

#### Sample code snippet
```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  error("Provide at least one search criteria") if input.blank?
  get("", input)
end
```

## Response validation
Some APIs do not use response codes to indicate an error with a request. These APIs may respond with `200` HTTP code and error messages in the response body.

By default, the SDK framework will only raise errors when the HTTP response code indicates an error. Since Sage Intacct returns a response of 200 with the error nested inside its response message, it is important to validate all responses and raise an error if one is present in the response body.

### `detect_on`
There are 2 ways you can catch these errors. The first method is to use [detect_on](/developing-connectors/sdk/authentication/custom-authentication.md#using-the-detect-on-block) in the `connection` definition. This is a connector-wide method to catch errors; It applies to all actions and triggers. Furthermore, this method will raise errors with a standard message format that cannot be customized.

### `after_response`
The alternative is to handle these errors in the [after_response](/developing-connectors/sdk/http-requests-and-response-handling.md#response-handling) method. This method can be used together with `error()` to validate the contents of a HTTP response and raise custom errors. This method applies to individual actions/triggers. Hence the condition(s) used to detect an error can be customized to each request. Additionally, the error message can be changed to suit each actions/triggers.

For example, we can use the `after_response` method to check the contents of the response body before deciding to return the body as a successful request output or to raise an error with a custom message.

#### Sample code snippet
```ruby
post("https://api.intacct.com/ia/xml/xmlgw.phtml", payload).
  format_xml("request").
  after_response do |code, body, headers|
    result = body.dig("response", 0, "operation", 0, "result", 0)
    if result.dig("status", 0, "content!") == "failure"
      error(result.dig("errormessage", 0))
    else
      result["data"]
    end
  end
```

### `after_error_response`
`after_error_response` is a helper method that can be chained to a HTTP verb method to handle HTTP responses; In particular, when the API responses with an error response code.

This method accepts 2 arguments. First, a number which represents the exact error code that you wish to handle.

Next, it also accepts a conditional block that will be executed when a HTTP response code matching the first argument is received.

#### Sample code snippet
Let's take a look at an `after_error_response` example, using **Airtable** API.

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  patch("https://api.airtable.com/v0/#{connection['base_id']}/users/#{id}", payload).
    after_error_response(404) do |code, body, header, message|
      error("#{message}: #{body}")
    end
end
```

When you try to update a row with an invalid ID, a HTTP error will be returned. The Error code used is `404` with a JSON body `{"error":"NOT_FOUND"}`.

## Picklist error handling
The `after_error_response` helper method can also be chained to HTTP verb methods in other parts of your custom connector. For example, you may want to handling and provide custom error messages from dynamic [pick_lists](/developing-connectors/sdk/pick-list.md). In this example, we are looking at handling errors from [Docparser](https://dev.docparser.com/).

#### Sample code snippet
```ruby
pick_lists: {
  parsers: lambda do
    get('https://slack.com/api/users.list').
      after_error_response(400) do |code, body, headers, message|
        error("Error loading parser pick list: #{body[/(?<=error\"\:\").*(?=\"\})/]}")
      end.
      pluck("label", "id")
  end
}
```

HTTP error will be displayed in the recipe editor when the custom adapter tries to load the pick list. In the example, the API key was reset, resulting in an invalid API keys used in the request.

## Object definition error handling
This can also be used in [dynamic fields](/developing-connectors/sdk/object-definition.md#dynamic-object-definitions) code block in object_definitions.

#### Sample code snippet
```ruby
object_definitions: {
  parsed_data: {
    fields: ->(_, config_fields) {
      get("https://api.docparser.com/v1/results/#{config_fields['parser_id']}1/schema").
      after_error_response(400) do |code, body, headers, message|
        error("Error loading parser schema: body[/(?<=error\"\:\").*(?=\"\})/]")
      end
    }
  }
}
```

HTTP error will be displayed in the recipe editor when the custom adapter tries to fetch schema for an unknown parser.
