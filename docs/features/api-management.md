## API Platform

Workato API Platform is a full-lifecycle API management platform that lets you build, maintain and consume APIs completely in the cloud.

Monitor your APIs with the API dashboard. Control access to your endpoints with clients and access profiles. Make it your own API with a full suite of customizations.

Develop and release APIs seamlessly between development, testing, and production with [recipe lifecycle management](/recipe-development-lifecycle.md).
