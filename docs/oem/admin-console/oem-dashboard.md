# OEM Dashboard

The OEM dashboard is the main landing page of the OEM Admin Console. It gives OEM partners an aggregated, overall view of all customers, connections and recipes used across all customer accounts, enabling you to get an overview of the health of the product. Use the dashboard to monitor your customer accounts by seeing stats and metrics that tell you their usage of the product as well as giving you insights into the apps and integrations they most often use.

The dashboard is split into 3 distinct sections, each providing information on different usage metrics. Read on to find out what the numbers in each section represent.

## Connections

*OEM Dashboard: Connections*

This section of the dashboard first gives a total connection count across all customer account. A connection here refers to an app connection that is successfully authenticated in a customer account. Note that it does not have to be used in a running recipe to be added to this count. Connections created in your OEM admin account is not added to this number.

The graph at the top shows the trend in connection count for the last 6 months, while the section below lists the count of the top 10 most popular apps. The apps displayed here can influence the type of recipes and solutions that you choose to showcase or provide more of in the [OEM community](/oem/oem-community.md). It also gives you insights into the verticals or use cases most popular amongst your customers.

## Customers

*OEM Dashboard: Customers*

The Customer section of the dashboard first gives you a total count of customers and the trend in this number in the last 6 months. Note that all customers including those with 'Subscription expired' are added to this count. If you want a customers removed from this count, please [delete the customer account](/oem/admin-console/customers.md).

The customer leaderboard that follows shows you the customer leaderboard by active recipes. This gives you a brief idea of the customers that are most and least engaged on your platform, ripe for upsell or review and those that need attention. To drill down deeper into individual customers, you can click on the individual customer names to head over to their [customer information page](/oem/admin-console/customers.md).

This is overall view of customer health. Drill down into more detailed stats for each customer in the [Customers tab](/oem/admin-console/customers.md#customer-information) where all customers and details are listed.

## Recipes

*OEM Dashboard: Recipes*

The final section in the dashboard shows you the count of all active recipes in customer accounts. This is an important metric since each active recipe in a customer account means a successful integration that is providing value and doing work on behalf of a customer! Similar to the other two sections, the top graph shows you the trend in active recipes across customer accounts for the past 6 months.

The 'Recommended recipes' section below shows you the number of times your recommended recipes have been cloned by customers. The top 5 recipes with the most number of clones will appear on the dashboard. Learn more about promoting recipes in your customer community in the [Recommended recipes](/oem/oem-community.md#shared-recipes) documentation.
