# OEM Community building

As an OEM partner, understanding the integration needs of your customers and the knowledge of your own app and APIs are paramount to creating the best user experience. The OEM Community allows you to customize the [Community recipes](https://www.workato.com/recipes/browse) browse results to include recommended recipes built by you and the apps that are most relevant to your customer community.   

With these tools, sharing useful recipes will help your customers kickstart their integration building on the white labelled or embedded platform quickly.

## Recommended apps
The out-of-the-box OEM branding configuration allows you to specify a list of recommended apps so these apps always show up at the top of the list. This list of applications can be the most popular applications amongst your customers that they want to connect to your application.

*Recommended apps*

To add or update this list of applications, please contact your Customer Success manager. There is a maximum of 16 apps. You may also choose to display the full list of Workato apps instead.

## Shared recipes
The recipe sharing feature allows OEM partners to share useful template recipes with customers.

The recipes that are shared by you will always be the top search results when users browse for community recipes. They will appear with a unique tag; In the example below, the starred tag `ACME Recommended` is an OEM partner-shared recipe.

Your customers can easily identify these recipes and make a copy in their account by clicking on 'Use this recipe'.

### Add a shared recipe
