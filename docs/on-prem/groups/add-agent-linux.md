Once you have selected an on-prem group or created a new one, you will then be prompted to create an agent.

Clicking on **Add on-prem agent** will bring you through an agent creation wizard to setup, run and verify that your agent is active. The wizard will take you through the following steps.

For this example, we will setup an on-prem agent on a Linux OS.

| -------------- | :---------- |
