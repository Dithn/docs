Our engineers are hard at work daily to make Workato better! View the latest updates to our platform below.

## New connectors
###### Oct 2019

### BIM 360 (Autodesk)
BIM 360 is construction management software that connects project teams and data in real-time from design through construction. Workato's BIM 360 connector allows you to manage your projects, files, folders and drawings in BIM 360 and connect them to all our other applications.

## Activity audit log
###### Oct 10, 2019

### Why this is important
Business systems group in a lot of enterprises consists of big teams developing and managing automations. As team size grows, it becomes important to track and audit changes made by the team members so that disruptions to business are minimized by unintended changes.

### What this means
Activity audit log provides quick and easy access to events, operations and actions done by users of Workato workspace. It is a critical tool for administrators to monitor changes done to the integrations. Activity audit log is available in the Dashboard > Audit  tab.

### Benefits
- Critical investigation tool in case of unauthorized or unintended operations
- Create activity audit document for compliance purposes
- Visibility and monitoring in a collaborative team environment
- Helps administrators answer questions such as -
  - Which user stopped the recipe? When?
  - When did user last login?
  - What actions a user has taken in last 7 days?
  - Who invited a collaborator?
  - When was my connection modified? By Who?

## Job debug tracing
###### Oct 25, 2019

### Why this is important
Many a times recipes and actions in the recipe may run into an error requiring debugging. For example, if a customer gets `404 Not Found` when updating incident in ServiceNow as part of incident management automation. As the size and complexity of the project grows, so does the time consumed in debugging errors. Whether Workato is used by developers, integration specialists or citizen developers, it is critically important to make it easy to find and debug errors so developers can spend more time building automations.

### What we’ve done

- Most connectors make HTTP requests as part of each action (for example, actions like  Update Record or Search Record by the Salesforce connector)
- This feature traces HTTP request details for each action in the recipe
- Shows HTTP URL, headers, request and response for each HTTP request
- Available in the Debug tab of the action line when a job is rerun

### Benefits

- Increase developer velocity in building functional Workato recipes (because of faster identification, investigation, and resolution of issues)
- Respond to and solve production issues faster
- Shorten duration of  impact to user experience during production issues
- Reduce time and cost in troubleshooting issues

###### Sept 25, 2019

### What is Block kit on Workbot
- Leverages [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit), Slack’s UI framework
- Allows more control and flexibility over the message layout and interactive elements
- Stack and re-order blocks

### What does this mean?
- Richer messages in post message / post command reply actions
- New date picker block
- New overflow menu block
- New divider block
- Ease of use - easier to add blocks, re-arrange by dragging & dropping

## On-prem groups
###### Sept 16, 2019

### Key Value Propositions:
- High Availability (HA) and Load Balancing
- Customer Experience
- Prevent Data and Revenue Loss

[On-prem groups](/on-prem/groups.md) help achieve zero downtime for recipes that involves on-prem connections and prevent data and revenue loss through missing SLAs. All critical workflows running on on-prem connections are kept running 100% of the time because recipe can process jobs successfully even when one of the user’s on-prem servers goes down.

### How it works:
- Users can add multiple agents to each group
- A connection uses an on-prem group to interact with on-prem apps instead of through a single agent
- Connection is live and recipe can process jobs successfully even when one of the user’s on-prem server goes down

## Robust data protection and compliance with flexible data retention
###### Sept 01, 2019

Securing customer data is a core value of our platform. With data protection standards, such as GDPR, and the sheer mass of data that companies collect and accumulate, the protection and control of information has become increasingly important.

### What is flexible data retention?
- Customers can customize their data retention period to fit their compliance policies
- Data retention periods can be set in hours or days
- The retention periods will vary by plan

### Why is this important?
Due to highly publicized instances of data breach, most enterprise customers are sensitive and insistent on protecting their data. With the flexible and lower data retention period support, data breach exposure is limited since Workato will destroy the data when data retention period ends.

### How do I change the data retention period?
Customer administrator or account owner of Business and above plans can navigate to `Account Settings` > `Data retention` to configure data retention. Specify number of hours or days and the data retention period unit.

## Recipe collections
###### Aug 16, 2019

Recipe Collections are a group of curated recipes that work together to solve a specific use case. Recipe Collections expect to bring customer centric view of the automations instead of a recipe centric view. We hope to improve discoverability of automation possibilities and better communicate the problems solved and value of recipes.

View the first release of recipe collections at: https://www.workato.com/recipes/browse.

## Connector SDK version control and release management
###### Aug 10, 2019

The latest updates to the [connector SDK](/developing-connectors/sdk/quick-Start.md) enable customers to manage versions of the connector, rollback or roll forward to a specific version, control which version of the connector is used in recipes, and sharing custom connectors across workspaces.

### Auto-versioning
Similar to recipe versioning, connector SDKs are automatically versioned when changes are made.

### Version rollback and roll forward
It is easy to view the history of changes made to the connector by browsing the versions. Users can deploy a specific version by simply choosing to revert to that version of the connector.

### Releasing a version
Users can now control which version of their custom connector is used in recipes by choosing to release a stable version of it. They can then continue building their custom connector without it affecting any active running recipes.

### Sharing a custom connector
Users can share a custom connector across workspaces using share links or our recipe lifecycle management feature. When new versions of a custom connector are released, cloned connectors get a notification to upgrade to the latest released version.

### Key benefits:
- Active safeguards against the unwanted syntax errors spoiling recipes. 
- Ability to release stable versions and continue development without implicating live recipes.
- Ability to roll back unwanted changes
- Greater control over custom connector management
- Enhanced developer experience 


## Connector update: Hubspot
###### Jul 20, 2019

Check out our [last update](#major-connector-update-hubspot) on Hubspot for more information on the latest major Hubspot connector enhancement.

#### HubSpot Companies API Support
Support has been added for the Company object in Hubspot with the following triggers/actions:

**Triggers:**
- New company
- New/updated company

**Actions:**
- Create company
- Update company
- Get company details by ID
- Search companies by domain name

#### HubSpot Additional OAuth Scopes
Support has been added for users to select multiple OAuth scopes when establishing a connection with our HubSpot connector. This will allow you to build custom actions for HubSpot APIs beyond the scope of Contacts, Deals, Engagements and Companies.


## Connector update: Wrike
###### Jul 17, 2019

#### Custom fields selector on triggers and actions
The custom field selector has been added to the Wrike connector's triggers and actions. This field selector is usually implemented on applications that usually have many customer-defined custom fields (eg. Salesforce, Quickbase).

The Fields list input field allows users to select the fields they wish to use in the recipe. This ensures that the recipe will be affected only by changes to these subset of fields, and therefore minimize impact on the recipe due to schema changes. Some benefits include:

- Improved recipe performance
- Improved recipe usability due to smaller datatree with only relevant datapills
- Minimizes impact on recipe by Salesforce object schema changes


## Connector update: Marketo
###### Jul 06, 2019

#### Marketo upsert leads in batches
The Marketo connector has been enhanced with a new action: Upsert lead (Batch). By utilizing bulk APIs to sync large amounts of data, fewer jobs are needed and fewer API calls to move the same amount of data. As a result, recipe run time often decreases.

The action accepts a list of 300 leads at maximum.


## Major connector update: Hubspot
###### Jun 30, 2019


#### Update details
The Hubspot connector has been updated to support [new triggers, actions and custom fields](https://www.workato.com/integrations/hubspot).

The new set of triggers and actions enables automation of marketing workflows for campaign management, email list generation, lead enrichment, lead tracking, customer onboarding, partner onboarding, and more. They enable Hubspot customers to build custom workflows, connect to on-prem apps/databases, and perform bulk operations e.g. syncing millions of contacts with Salesforce or Mailchimp.

## Platform security: Just-in-Time provisioning now supports custom roles
###### Jun 23, 2019

#### What is Just-in-time provisioning
Just-in-Time provisioning enables customers to use a SAML assertion to create users in downstream  apps e.g. Workato on-demand when users log into the app for the very first time.
This eliminates the need to manually provision user accounts in advance. For example, instead of manually creating a Workato account for a new employee customers can use Just-in-Time provisioning to dynamically create the Workato account when the new employee initially logs in using Single Sign On (SSO).

#### For Whom
- Available for all plans that include SSO & Teams
- All current accounts using Teams with SAML based SSO (e.g. OKTA, One Login or other)

#### Why we built it
- Supporting custom roles for Just-in-time provisioning allows customers to enforce custom security policies for Workato
- The standard roles Admin, Analyst, and operator available with Just-in-time provisioning  don't suffice for customer's security policies

#### How it works
- First, Workato admin creates a custom role e.g.mktg_ops for marketingOps that can only access, create, or modify objects (recipes, connections,OPA etc.) in the Marketing folder.
- Next, the authentication method is set to SAML based SSO (e.g. Okta, OneLogin) with SAML JIT enabled.
- The 3rd party identity provider (i.e. Okta, Onelogin) is configured to use the custom role value e.g. mktg_ops for the workato_role as one of the SAML attributes
- When a user logs into Workato using SAML based SSO for the first time, the identity provider (i.e. Okta,OneLogin) passes the custom role value e.g. mktg_ops for workato_role.
- The user's Workato account is then automatically provisioned with the custom role i.e. mktg_ops

#### Why it is useful
- *Reduced Administrative Costs:* Eliminates manual work to provision Workato accounts thus reducing cost of operations.
- *Increased Security:* In addition to the access/security policies enforced by the identity provider, customers can now enforce custom security policies for Workato accounts.
- *Faster Onboarding & improved employee experience:* New hires have faster access to Workato accounts with the right access privileges.

## Platform security: Two-factor authentication
###### Jun 12, 2019

#### What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Two-Factor Authentication is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information. This second factor could come from one of the following categories:

1. **Something you know:** This could be a personal identification number (PIN), a password, answers to “secret questions” or a specific keystroke pattern
2. **Something you have:** Typically, a user would have something in their possession, like a credit card, a smartphone, or a small hardware token
3. **Something you are:** This category is a little more advanced, and might include biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voice print

**Source**: https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/

#### For Whom
- Available for all plans
- All existing and new accounts

#### How it works
Workato's two-factor authentication uses a software generated time-based, one-time passcode (also called TOTP, or soft-token)
- First, a user must download and install a free 2FA app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, or other) on their smartphone or desktop
- Next, they will need to go to their Account settings section to enable two-factor authentication.
- When enabled, the user will be prompted to go through a couple of simple steps to activate 2FA for their account

#### Why is it useful
- Customers can add a secondary layer of security to protect unauthorized and fraudulent access to their Workato account
- Similar to SSO, enterprise IT teams can now use 2FA to alleviate risks by enforcing security policies that require 2FA.
- Enables secure onboarding of collaborators to a team
- Eliminates the painful policy for periodic password reset

#### Resources
- [Documentation](/security/two-factor-authentication.md)

## Webhooks wizard
###### Jun 03, 2019

#### Background: Why webhooks?
Webhooks is part of a larger platform offering: custom connectivity. While we have a strong list of triggers out of the box, user data shows that 44% of our users require custom connectivity to some extent. It is typically used to connect to proprietary or legacy apps.

Users use need webhooks for time-sensitive use cases. These use cases require real-time triggering of workflows like requesting an outbound call to a lead downloading the company ebook.

#### For Whom
- Users looking to build recipes with real-time triggers
- Available to all plans

#### Why we built it
Webhooks has been a key part of many customer use cases. In the last year alone, Workato saw more than 2.5x increase in the number of recipes using webhook triggers to enable real-time automation. This trend is expected to continue increasing exponentially. We want to make the user experience for this popular trigger the best out there.

#### How it works
This wizard takes the user through a guided flow to test and verify a webhook trigger. We take the information from this test to configure the metadata automatically.

#### What problems does it solve for you
Unlike other products in the iPaaS space, building a webhooks trigger can now take less than 5 mins (down from 15-30 minutes). Often, users will need to switch back and forth between the recipe and their app.
Additionally, users need to learn/understand the webhooks metadata - what the webhook schema looks like, which HTTP method and data type to expect.
Lastly, it is difficult to verify that a webhook trigger is configured correctly. Users needed to do end-to-end tests with active recipes.

1. Simplify UX - users can verify if the webhook trigger works immediately.
2. Reduce skill barrier and human error - wizard detects key information  and uses it to configure the trigger automatically.

## Automation Dashboard And Job History Search
###### May 05, 2019

#### For Whom
- Customers looking to monitor mission and business critical automations
- Operators/Admins responsible for triaging/resolving issues quickly for SLA
- All plans

#### Challenges Addressed
- Elimination of manual steps to analyze and discover issues across all recipes in an account
- Lack of visibility into historical trends in jobs processed/failed to analyze health of all recipes in an account.
- Extremely time consuming manual process of reviewing log for each job run for auditing and triaging issues. Unsustainable for recipes with 100s of jobs.

#### How it works
Users have instant visibility into the health of recipes, connections, OPA, jobs from a single view- Automation Dashboard.

- Real-time visualization of data pertaining to recipes, connections, etc.
- Target issues that matter with filters to drill down to details of specific time periods, folders, recipe status
- Manage and fix errors that need immediate attention
- Google like search using keywords across all job history data

#### Why is it useful
- Faster discovery and resolution of issues increases uptime & improves SLA
- Significant savings in time and effort in monitoring all recipes for an account
- Unprecedented access to audit, troubleshoot and resolve issues to improve data quality & integrity

#### Competitive Advantage
For other iPaaS vendors:

- Dashboards provide operational insights using technical data vis-a-vis CPU, memory and I/O utilization & performance, and aggregated job run stats - requiring users to manually analyze and discover issues.
- Accessing and querying job history data/logs when available would require custom tooling or 3rd party tools.
