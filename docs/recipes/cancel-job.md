# Cancel job
Workato lets users cancel a running job. Running (or pending) status means the job is currently executing the actions defined in the recipe.

Oftentimes developers and operators may need to cancel a job in the processing status when:
- thereâ€™s a bug in the recipe
- a data issue
- wrong application sandbox is used
- the recipe may take a few minutes to an hour or more to complete

Recipes that execute bulk actions take minutes to hours to complete depending on the size of the data. Some examples are:
- Create/Update/Upsert records in bulk from CSV file in the `Salesforce` connector
- Add/Create in bulk in the `NetSuite` connector
- Bulk import leads from file in the `Marketo` connector
- `Wait` action in the `Scheduler` connector

You can cancel a job from the job details page. Simply click on the `Cancel job` button.

Before the job cancellation is complete, the job status will show as `Canceling`. The job status will be updated to `Canceled` once the cancellation is complete. The `Reason for cancel` in the job details page is updated to `Job canceled by user`.

# Callable recipes
Canceling a parent recipe job generally will not cancel the callable recipes. If the callable recipe is called in an asynchronous mode then the called recipe job will run independently to completion.

# Long actions
Long actions are actions in the recipe that usually deals with handling bulk data. As such, these long actions take minutes to hours to complete depending on the size of the data. Developers and operators may find it useful to cancel a job when such long action steps are in the recipe. It is typically supported by the applications like Salesforce, Marketo, NetSuite and more. Here is list of long actions.
