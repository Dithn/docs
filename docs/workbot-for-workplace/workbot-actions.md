# Workbot for Workplace actions
Workbot actions allow you to post messages & replies to users or channels as Workbot.

Additionally, Workbot also includes custom actions. This action allows you to utilize [Facebook's Graph APIs (v4.0)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/).

Workbot supports 6 actions:
* [Post simple reply](#post-simple-reply)
* [Post simple message](#post-simple-message)
* [Post reply](#post-reply)
* [Post message](#post-message)
* [Post attachment](#post-attachment)
* Custom action

## Post simple reply
Post simple reply allows you to post a simple text message back to the user that invokes a Workbot command. Replies are posted directly to the user or in-channel, depending on where the command was invoked.

> **Post simple reply must be used together with a Workbot command**

You can optionally include quick reply buttons, which are displayed below the message and can invoke another Workbot command recipe when clicked by a user.

## Post simple message
Post simple message allows you to post a simple text message to a user or channel, without having to use a Workbot command as the trigger. It is similar to **Post reply**, but with an additional field called **Send message to**. This field allows you to specify where to post the simple message (direct to user, or to channel).

Since the trigger event can come from another application (e.g. new incident in ServiceNow), **Post simple message** is useful in posting Workplace notifications for events that occur in another application.

Use post simple message if you:

1. Are using Workbot to post simple event notifications from another application, e.g. New/updated incident in ServiceNow. Since the trigger event can come from another application, **Post message** should be used, so you can specify who to send the message to.

2. Want control over where Workbot should post the message, instead of sending it where the Workbot command was invoked (which is what **Post reply** does automatically)### Send message to
**Send message to** allows you post a message to directly to a user or to a channel you specify. Use the <kbd>ID</kbd> datapill (under **Conversation**) from the output of a Workbot command. To pick a member or channel instead, toggle to "Select from list".

The **Post reply** action uses Facebook's [generic template](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/generic/).

You can optionally include quick reply buttons, which are displayed below the message and can invoke another Workbot command recipe when clicked by a user.
