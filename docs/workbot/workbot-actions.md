# Workato actions for Slack
Workbot actions allow Workbot to post notifications into a specified channel when there are events to take note of, or respond to a command.

Workbot supports 6 actions:
* [Post command reply](#post-command-reply)
* [Post notifications](#post-notifications)
* [Post message](#post-message)
* [Download attachment](#download-attachment)
* [Return menu options](#return-menu-options)
* [Upload file](#upload-file)
* [Open/update modal view](#open-update-modal-view-action)
* [Push modal view](#push-modal-view-action)

## Block kit compatibility
Blocks can be used together with existing message attachments present in the [Post command reply](#post-command-reply) and [Post message](#post-message).

For more information, see [Block kit](/workbot/block-kit.md).

## Post command reply
Post command reply allows you to customize how Workbot replies when an event is completed. This reply can be a simple message about the task completion, or a prompt for the user to take a subsequent action once the first has been done, e.g. after retrieving data for a custom account in Salesforce, ask if the user wishes to copy that information across to another application.

Here is what the Post Command Reply action's output will look like in Slack.

## Post message
This action will post a message response to a user who invokes a command. The post message action is similar to that of the post command reply, but has more features.

Use post message if you:

1. Are not using a post command in your trigger step

2. Want control over who (\@username) or where (\#channel_name) Workbot should respond to

3. Want to use advanced features like updating a previous message or posting/updating messages in a thread.

### Channel name/DM
**Channel name/DM** field allows you post a message in a specified Slack channel or direct message (DM). Use the <kbd>Channel/DM</kbd> datapill from a Post command trigger, or key in the channel name e.g. **#general** or username e.g. **\@john**.

![Message to update example](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/channel-dm.png)
*Message to update example*

### Advanced section
 The advanced section has 2 fields: <br>**Message to update** and **Thread ID**.

- #### Message to update
  **Message to update** allows you to overwrite a previously posted message from an earlier action step. Simply use the <code>Message ID</code> datapill from a **Post command** trigger, **Post message** action or **Post notification** output datatrees.

  ![Message to update example](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/message-to-update-example.png)
*Message to update example*

- #### Thread ID
  **Thread ID** allows you to post a message within an existing thread in Slack. Simply use the <code>Thread ID</code> datapill from a **Post message** or **Post notification** output datatree.

  ![Thread ID example](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/thread-id-example.png)
  *Thread ID example*

  If you don't see **Thread ID**, make sure it's checked in the 'Add/remove optional fields' section at the bottom of the post message action step:

  ![Thread ID example](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/thread-id-optional.png)


## Post notifications
This action allows you to define which Slack channel to post customized notifications to. By default, Workbot posts direct messages only to the user who installed Workbot. Note, it is also possible to subscribe from a channel (where Workbot participates) to these notifications.

The fields available are simillar to that of the **Post command reply** action, with all the typical fields you see in a Slack message. However, there is the addition of the field **Notification filter**. This field allows you to set parameters for filters, which acts like a trigger filter for sending out notifications (i.e. the notification will only get sent when the set criteria is met).

## Download attachment
This action allows you to download attachments from Slack, received as input to [**New command** trigger](/workbot/workbot-triggers.md#new-command-trigger-building-custom-commands). Make sure command parameter for uploaded content has type *file*, e.g. `attachment type:file`. Pass file URL from **New command** output into the **URL** field to get attachment content. Then you may further pass this file content to Dropbox, Box or other connectors to upload them as files.

## Return menu options
This action allows you to dynamically generate menu options, then return them to a dynamic menu in a Slack dialog.

For Workbot command recipes that invoke dialogs, a `select` field can be defined with dynamic menu options.

![Dynamic menu](~@img/workbot/workbot-trigger/dynamic-menu.png/)
*A Workbot command recipe with dynamic menu options*

After retrieving a list of records from another app (e.g. Salesforce), you can return them back to the dynamic menu by using the **Return menu options** action.

![Return menu options recipe](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/return-menu-options-recipe.png)
*Retrieving Salesforce opportunities before returning them as menu options back to the Slack dialog with the dynamic menu*

Hence, this action should always be paired with a [New dynamic menu event](/workbot/workbot-triggers.md#new-dynamic-menu-event) trigger.

### Input
By default, you can specify a static list of menu options by adding menu options 1-by-1.

![Add static menu option](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/add-static-menu-option.gif)
*Adding static menu options 1-by-1*

However, you can create a dynamic list by changing the input mode to dynamic. Simply pass a list datapill from the ouput of a previous action step.

![Static to dynamic menu options](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/switching-from-static-to-dynamic.gif)
*Configuring dynamic menu options*

Returned menu options are in an ungrouped list by default.

*Ungrouped options in recipe*

![Ungrouped options](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/ungrouped-options-slack.png)
*Ungrouped options in Slack*

When returning menu options, you can group menu options together by setting **Group menu options?** to **Yes**. This will require you to specify **Title of group** for each group you add.

![Grouped options in the recipe](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/grouped-options-recipe.png)
*Groups options look in recipe*

## Upload file
This action will upload a file to the specified channel, DM or thread. You can also include a simple message together with the file.

![Upload file with simple message](~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/upload-file-with-message.png)
*A short message before the Chat history.json file*

The following table lists the fields available in an **Upload file** action.

      <td>Uploads the file within an existing thread</td>
      <td>
        Use the <kbd>Thread ID</kbd> datapill from the output datatree of a <b>Post message</b> or <b>Post command reply</b> to upload the file to an existing thread. <br><img src="~@img/workbot/workbot-actions/thread-id-example.png"></img><br>If no thread exists yet, use the <kbd>Message ID</kbd> datapill instead. This will create a new thread for the uploaded file.
      </td>
    </tr>

## Modals
Modals allow you to build rich, interactive and dynamic views that collect information from users in a structured manner.
![Modal example](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/pretty-modal.png)

## Modal view input
The following table describes the configuration when working with Modals. This applies for the Open/update modal view action and the Push modal view action.

<table class="unchanged rich-diff-level-one">

            <td>
                Modal views can only be opened by interactive components (like buttons & menus), modal submissions, message actions, shortcuts, and slash commands. When users interact with or use these features, a trigger ID is generated. You can grab these from the New command trigger dataree under the Modals object.

The parameter names in both upstream & downstream recipes must match.<br><br>Parameters can be passed either in comma-separated name-value pairs, e.g. name: John Smith, user_id: AB12345 or in JSON, e.g. {"opportunity_id": "OPP1234567"}. When using JSON, you can also pass array or object parameters.<br><br>It's important to ensure the parameter names and data types match their upstream counterparts, e.g. when using <code>opportunity_id</code> as a singleline input in the view of modal (rendered in an upstream recipe), also specify <code>opportunity_id</code> as a string parameter in the <b>New command</b> of the downstream recipe.

## Open/update modal view action
You can open or update modals using the same action: Open/update modal view.
![Open/update modal view](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/open-update-modal-view.png)

To open, update or push Modals, **Trigger ID** is always required. Trigger IDs are generated by Slack when users interact with:
- buttons,
- menus,
- overflow,
- select menus,
- datepickers,
- radio buttons,
- shortcuts,
- message actions,
- slash commands,
- modal view submissions

### Opening a modal view
Once a modal view is open, you can choose to update the view, or push a new view on top of it.

To open a modal, use **Trigger ID**. You can find **Trigger ID** from the datatree of the **New command** trigger.
![Trigger ID](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/trigger-id.png)
*Trigger ID for modal found in the New command trigger*

### Updating a modal view
To update a modal, provide both the **Trigger ID** and the **View ID** of the view you want to update. Learn more about the [modal input fields](/workbot/modals.md#modal-view-input).

### When to update modals
Typically, bot commands update the active view they exist in (View ID).
![Update modal](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/update-modal.gif)
*Making changes on the active view*

In contrast, modal submissions usually update the root view (Root View ID) or the previous view (Previous View ID). These views can be found in the **New command trigger** datatree, under **Modals**.

![Modals object in New command trigger datatree](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/modals-in-datatree.png)
*Root View ID and Previous View ID found in the New command trigger*

::: warning
When a view is submitted, it closes by default. Use the correct View ID when updating views in response to view submissions.
:::

## Push modal view action
This action pushes a modal on top of the active view. To push a modal view, use **Trigger ID** (no View ID is required). You can find trigger ID from the datatree of the **New command** trigger.
![Trigger ID](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/trigger-id.png)
*Trigger ID for modal found in the New command trigger*

This action requires an open modal view. Use the [Open/update modal view action](#opening-a-modal-view) to open a model view.

Typically, bot commands push views on top of the active view they exist in (**View ID**). The **View ID** can be found in the **New command trigger** datatree, under **Modals**.

![Push modal](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/push-modal.gif)

![Modals object in New command trigger datatree](~@img/workbot/workbot-blockkit/modals-in-datatree.png)
*Root View ID and Previous View ID found in the New command trigger*

::: warning
When a view is submitted, it closes by default. Take care to only push a modal view on top of an active view.
