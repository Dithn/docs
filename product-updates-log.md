## Dec 23 - Jan 08

### Connector enhancements

- **SAP On-premise connector:**

  **What's new:** The new [SAP On-premise connector](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/sap.html) that can connect to almost any SAP system on-premise or on a firewall protected server (including AWS, IBM, etc.). The supported SAP versions include SAP ERP ECC 6.0 and later, SAP CRM, SAP SRM, SAP SCM, and any other modules compatible with the NetWeaver platform.

  These actions allow the creation and update of up to 2,000 records at a time. Users should make use of these operations when they are creating or updating small batches of Salesforce records, or if they wish to perform multiple operations without using Bulk API.

  **Increased search action limit:** The actions **Search records, Search records (User)** and **Search records using query** can now be configured to return up to 50,000 records (up from 100).

- **Okta: Scheduled trigger**

  **What's new:** The new Okta Scheduled trigger allows a scheduled search instead of real-time exit.

## Dec 11 - Dec 22

### Connector enhancements

Reconnect all Wrike connections in your account to use the updated connector. You can complete this action on or after December 19th, 2018.


## Nov 25 - Dec 10

### Platform enhancements

- **New Recipe UI**

  **What's new**: The new recipe UI introduces a flowchart building interface that clearly displays the flow of logic through the entire recipe. Usability issues that have been raised have also been addressed in this design. Users should not only find this iteration of the recipe editor more user-friendly but also see new features that make their recipe building experience more efficient.

### Connector enhancements

- **New Google connectors**

  **What's new:** New Google connectors have been added to the list of apps Workato supports. These new connectors enable a variety of content analysis capabilities that bring a new level of intelligence to recipes and automations.

    - **Google Vision:** Read text from images and scanned documents
      Example use case: Read text from an uploaded driver's license and create a contact in Salesforce
    - **Google Speech-to-text:** Allows the conversion of a short speech-to-text transcript
    - **Google Text-to-speech:** Allows conversion of text to synthetic voice audio
    - **Google Translate:** Translate text between languages
      Example use case: call recordings / voice messages from foreign customer --> use Speech-to-text to transcribe to text --> use Translate to translate to English --> use Text-to-Speech to convert to audio, which customer support reps can listen.

- **ServiceNow: Subdomain routing**

  **Context**

  In development lifecycles, teams typically clone their sandbox instances for deployment into production. In the process, webhooks in the sandbox instance also get copied over into production. As a result, webhook events in production gets sent to the sandbox recipes, causing an error.

  **What's new: Subdomain routing for webhooks**

  To fix this, we’ve introduced subdomain routing. When an instance is cloned, the subdomain will change based on the instance it is in. This will ensure that webhooks in the cloned instance will be routed to the correct production recipe. To enable this behavior, simply stop and restart your ServiceNow recipes.


## Nov 11 - Nov 25

### Connector enhancements

- **HTTP: OAuth2 client credentials grant**

  **What's new:** The HTTP connector now allows connections using the OAuth2 client credentials grant flow. Using the client credentials grant, the client can request an access token using only its client credentials. This is usually used when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control.


## Oct 25 - Nov 10 2018

This enables limiting the connection's permissions to only the relevant ones for recipes connected to Box. We also added 2 new scopes: `Manage enterprise properties` and `Manage retention policies`. This allows buildings more powerful custom actions!

### Platform enhancements

- **Data pill enhancement**

  **Context:** We've greatly improved visibility on data pills when they are mapped into fields so that building and reviewing recipes can be done in a glance.

  **What's new:** All data pills have been revamped to include the application logo and step it comes from.

- **Added delete functionality for lookup tables**

  **What's new:** We have added the ability to delete **all data from lookup tables** without the need to delete the table entirely. Access this by clicking on the `...` menu icon on the last column of your lookup table.

- **Added delete functionality for custom adapters_schema**

  **What's new:** We have also added the ability to **remove custom (SDK) adapters**. Users can do so from their individual [custom adapters](https://www.workato.com/custom_adapters) pages.

### Connector enhancements

- **Quick Base: Bulk import action**

  **What's new:** We released a new [Quick Base bulk import action using CSV file](https://product.workato.com/2018/09/28/announcing-our-quick-base-bulk-import-action/). Users can now easily import a large amount of data into Quick Base with this addition. Documentation is available on: [Quick Base action: Create and update records in bulk from CSV file](/connectors/quick-base/action-import-csv.md)

- **Microsoft Dynamics CRM: Picklist lookup support**

    **Context:** It can be hard to retrieve the lookup values of picklists in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. In the API response, typically only the internal values of the picklist selection are returned.

    **What's new:** The [new feature](https://product.workato.com/2018/09/26/2053-picklist-lookups-for-dynamics-crm/) in our Microsoft Dynamics CRM connector now gives you both the picklist option labels as well as the internal values for your selected picklist option. These fields show up as additional fields for you to use in the datatree.

## Sept 4 - Sept 24 2018

### Platform enhancements

- **Group data mapping**

  **Context:** In a large enterprise database, there can be hundreds of fields in every table. When there are a daunting number of fields to map or if many of your field labels match with the name of pills, it can be a chore to do them one-by-one.

  **What's new:** Map fields automatically with the new group data mapping tool in every action. Click on the icon next to the 'comment', 'clone' and 'delete' icons on the right hand side on every recipe line to bring up the group mapping wizard. Simply choose the fields to map and the data source to get started.

  Read the documentation on [group data mapping](/recipes/group-data-mapping.md) to learn more.

- **New control for date/time picker**

  **What's new:** A new grid icon is available on the right of all date/time fields. Clicking on this icon will bring up a calendar date picker followed by a drop-down list of times. Use this new function to quickly configure dates and times. After selecting your chosen date or time, you may still edit this by typing in the field directly.

  For our more experienced users, please note that clicking on the calendar icon on the left of the field will no longer work.


### Connector enhancements

- **Workday: Trigger change**

  **Context:** Previously, large worker objects in Workday caused jobs to timeout.

  **What's new:** A new option under _Advanced configuration_ called 'Return reference only' available in Workday triggers allows the job to return only references and transaction logs, minimising the trigger data size to prevent timeouts

- **HTTP connector: Secondary connector**

  **What's new:** Previously, only 1 HTTP connection was allowed per recipe. The new secondary connector is useful when users need to connect to multiple REST endpoints. To use the HTTP secondary connector, access the adapter dropdown menu and click on the 'HTTP secondary' option.  

- **Salesforce new action: Salesforce bulk query using SOQL**

  **What's new:** The new action allows a bulk search for records in Salesforce with a SOQL query. Learn more about [using SOQL queries](https://support.workato.com/support/solutions/articles/1000236426-salesforce-object-query-language-soql-basic-syntax-and-common-search-terms) and about [Salesforce bulk API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm).

- **Recipe IQ: Powering intelligent recipe building**

  **Context:** The Workato platform uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms based on billions of integration events and hundreds of thousands of integration use cases to assist users in building effective integrations and automations.

  **What's new:** During recipe building, users may notice the `Powered by RecipeIQ` tag, which indicates that our AI algorithms are intelligently suggesting the best actions, data pills or fields for use.

- **Job report: Timing tab**

  **What's new:** The timing tab for every step in a recipe has been exposed. Users can find it next to the 'input' and 'output' tabs in the individual job reports. This tab shows the time taken for every action and can be used in debugging recipes.

### Connector enhancements

  **What's new:** Workato's `On-prem command-line scripts` connector allows you to run whitelisted command line scripts in your private network with an on-premises agent. Find out how to set a profile up on the [on-premises profile documentation](https://docs.workato.com/on-prem/profile.html#command-line-scripts-profile).

- **HTTP & Custom HTTP connectors**

  **Context:** Previously, users had to parse the HTTP response as text, then use the JSON parser as the next action to parse out the response.

  **What's new:** The HTTP adapter now supports JSON arrays and objects.

- **On-premises files connector major update**

  **What's new:**  Several new triggers and actions have been added to the connector, and the old versions of those triggers and actions have been deprecated.
